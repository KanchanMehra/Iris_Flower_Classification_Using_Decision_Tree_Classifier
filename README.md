# Iris_Flower_Classification_Using_Decision_Tree_Classifier

This project demonstrates the application of a Decision Tree Classifier to classify Iris flowers into three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their physical attributes. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for each flower.

The objective of this project is to use these attributes to predict the species of the Iris flowers. This project covers data exploration, preprocessing, training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.
